***Very beginning of Backend programming by Nodejs***

**Creating `RestApi`**

**Here when you hit some endpoints, you will get some `json` data.**

**Example:**

`http://localhost:3000/dishes/2` will send you the second dish
from dishes list as
`{"id":2,"name":"Grill"}`.

**You Can operate `GET`,`POST`,`PUT`, and `DELETE` operation**
